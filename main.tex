\begin{abstract}
	The Fermilab SeaQuest experiment has measured dimuon events from the interaction
	of \SI{120}{\GeV} proton beam on liquid hydrogen and deuterium targets with dimuon
	mass between \num{2} and \SI{9}{\GeV}. These dimuon events contain both the Drell-Yan
	process and the charmonium ($J/\psi$ and $\psi^\prime$) production. Unlike the Drell-Yan process
	which probes the antiquark distributions in the nucleons, the charmonium production
	is sensitive to both quark and gluon distributions. SeaQuest has extracted the
	$\sigma^{pd}/2\sigma^{pp}$ ratios as well as the differential cross sections for
	charmonium production in the kinematic region of $0.4 < x_F < 0.9$. The $\sigma^{pd}/2\sigma^{pp}$
	ratios for charmonium production are found to be significantly different
	from that of the Drell-Yan process. The measured differential cross sections for
	charmonium production are compared with theoretical calculations.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The SeaQuest experiment at Fermilab was designed to measure high-mass dimuons
produced in the interaction of \SI{120}{\GeV} proton beam with various targets.
Dimuons originating from the Drell-Yan process \cite{drell1970} as well as the
decay of quarkonium states were collected simultaneously. Results from SeaQuest
on the $\sigma^{pd}/2\sigma^{pp}$ Drell-Yan cross section ratios, which are sensitive to
the flavor asymmetry of $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ in the proton, were reported recently
\cite{dove2021}.

Unlike the Drell-Yan process which primarily involves the annihilation of quark
and antiquark via electromagnetic interaction, charmonium production proceeds
via strong interaction containing contributions from both the quark-antiquark
annihilation and the gluon-gluon fusion processes.

While proton-induced charmonium production is expected to be dominated by gluon-gluon
fusion process \cite{vogt1999}, some contributions form the quark-antiquark
annihilation process is also expected. The relative importance of these two
processes is expected to depends on the energy of the colliding hadron as well
as the Feynman-$x$ ($x_F$) of the charmonium \cite{peng1995}. The quark-antiquark
annihilation process is sensitive to the light sea-quark asymmetry in the proton,
as in the case of Drell-Yan process, while the gluon-gluon fusion process is expected 
to be identical for the reaction on hydrogen and deutrium targets. 

The NA51 Collaboration reported the simultaneous measurement of the charmonium
production and Drell-Yan for $p+p$ and $p+d$ at \SI{450}{\GeV} at a single value
of rapidity \cite{abreu1998}. The measurement by SeaQuest covers the kinematic
range of $0.3<x_F<0.8$. The \SI{120}{\GeV} beam energy in the SeaQuest experiment
is expected to probe the parton distribution at a larger values of $x$ than the
NA51 experiment at \SI{450}{\GeV}.


\section{E906/SeaQuest Experiment}
\label{sec:e906}
SeaQuest is a fixed-target experiment utilizing the \SI{120}{\GeV} proton beam
from the Fermilab Main Injector. Details of the SeaQuest spectrometer can be
found in Ref.~\cite{aidala2019}. The target system consists of seven
interchangeable targets, including a flask with liquid hydrogen, a flask with
liquid deuterium, an empty flask (vacuum), solid carbon, iron, and tungsten
targets as well as an empty space with no target (air). The targets are interchanged
periodically to reduce systematic uncertainties in the measured cross section
ratios for the different targets.

The spectrometer consists of two magnets and four tracking stations. FMag, is a
solid iron magnet that acts as the beam dump as well as a focusing magnet. It is
then followed by the first tracking stations. An open air dipole magnet (KMag) is
placed between station 1 and station 2. The vertical magnetic field from both
magnets bends the muons horizontally, allowing the measurement of the momentum
of the muons. Downstream of station 3, there is a 1 m iron wall acting as a
hadron absorber. Station 4 is located behind the hadron absorber and acts as a
muon identifier. Tracks that pass through the hadron absorber and
produce hits on station 4 are assumed to be from muons.

\section{Extraction of \texorpdfstring{$J/\psi$}{J/psi} cross section}
\label{sec:result}
Data collection for SeaQuest ran from April 2014 to July 2017. The analysis
presented here is performed on data collected until August 2015, about half
of the entire data set. After applying various analysis cuts to select
candidate dimuon events from the liquid hydrogen target, the dimuon invariant
mass distribution is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mass}. The $J/\psi$ peak and $\psi^\prime$
shoulder are clear visible and are the predominant source of signal at the 
lower mass region. The mass distribution is fitted with several different
components. First, the mass spectrum from the data collected with the 
empty target flask, properly normalized by the integrated beam intensity,
is included. Second the expected mass distributions for $J/\psi$ and 
$\psi^\prime$, based on the analysis of the GEANT4 based Monte-Carlo
simulation, which takes into account the spectrometer acceptance. The Drell-Yan
Monte-Carto, generated using a next-to-leading order calculation and CT14 parton
distributions, are also analyzed. The random background is then simulated by
using the data collected with a ``single-muon'' trigger. Two ``single-muon''
events are combined to create a simulated ``dimuon'' events, which is then sent
through the same analysis chain. The data is then fitted to a sum of these
different components to obtained the normalization for each components. The
data are well described by this fitting procedure. This fitting procedure
can also described the mass distribution in each kinematic bin.

		In the lower mass region, the predominant signal is from the decay
		of $J/\psi$ and $\psi^\prime$. }
	\label{fig:mass}
\end{figure}

After the number of $J/\psi$ events is extracted from the mass distributions,
the quarkonium production cross section is obtained from the yields as follows
\begin{equation}
	B\dv{\sigma}{x_F} = \frac{N_{\textrm{events}}}{\Delta x_F \mathcal{L} \epsilon},
\end{equation}
where $B$ is the branching ratio for $J/\psi$ to decay into a muon pair,
$\epsilon$ is the spectrometer acceptance and efficiency correction, and
$\mathcal{L}$ is the effective luminosity. The spectrometer acceptance and
efficiency correction are obtained by studying the Monte-Carlo simulation.
We define the following kinematic variables for the $J/\psi$:
\begin{align}
x_F &= \frac{2P^L_{CM}}{\sqrt{s}},\\
x_b &= \frac{\textbf{P}_{\textrm{target}}\cdot\textbf{P}_{\textrm{sum}}}{\textbf{P}_{\textrm{target}} \cdot\left(\textbf{P}_{\textrm{beam}}+\textbf{P}_{\textrm{target}}\right)},\\
x_t &= \frac{\textbf{P}_{\textrm{beam}}\cdot\textbf{P}_{\textrm{sum}}}{\textbf{P}_{\textrm{beam}} \cdot\left(\textbf{P}_{\textrm{beam}}+\textbf{P}_{\textrm{target}}\right)},
\end{align}
where $P^L_{CM}$ is the dimuon longiudinal momentum in the nucleon-nucleon
center-of-mass (CM) frame, $s$ is the CM energy squared. $x_b$ and $x_t$ are
the fraction of the hadron momentum carried by the parton in the beam and
target nucleon, receptively. They are defined using the four momentum of
the beam hadron ($\textbf{P}_{\textrm{beam}}$), target hadron ($\textbf{P}_{\textrm{target}}$)
and the dimuon $\textbf{P}_{\textrm{sum}}$.

To compare the measured $J/\psi$ production cross section with theoretical
expectations, we have performed calculation using the Next-to-Leading
order (NLO) Color Evaporation Model (CEM)\cite{mangano1993} and
Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) model \cite{bodwin1997}. In both models, the heavy
quark-antiquark ($\bar{Q}Q$) pair production via various QCD hard processes
is calculated using purturbative QCD. The main difference between the two
models is in the hadronization into specific quarkonium state.
In the CEM framework, a constant probability $F$, specific for each charmonium
state, accounts for the hadronization into colorless charmonium state. In contrast,
in NRQCD, the hadronization is described by a set of long-distance matrix elements
(LDMEs) which depend on the spin, color and angular momentum of the $\bar{Q}Q$ pairs.

The model predictions from both model for the $J/\psi$ production with a \SI{120}{\GeV}
proton beam are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:jpsi_theory}. At forward $x_F$, both models suggest
that quark-antiquark annihilation is more important than gluon-gluon fusion, but NRQCD
give somewhat greater importance for the quark-antiquark annihilation.

		and red dashed line.}

The preliminary result of $\frac{d\sigma}{dx_F}$ from SeaQuest are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:abs_cs_NRQCD}, and compared with both the CEM and NRQCD calculation.
The main sources of systematic uncertainties comes from the modeling of the random background
and the beam luminosity normalization. The normalization of the CEM calculation,
which accounts for the hadronization probability, is adjusted to fit the data. The line
shape of the extracted cross section is in good agreement with CEM. For the NRQCD
calculation, the LDMEs are taken from \cite{hsieh2021}, which are extracted from
a global analysis of pion and proton induced charmonium production in fixed-target
experiments. The overall normalization and the line shape of the extracted cross
section are also in good agreement with the NRQCD calculation.

\end{figure}


The $\sigma^{pd}/2\sigma^{pp}$ cross section ratios can also be obtained. As most of the
systematic uncertainties are correlated between the hydrogen and deuterium targets,
they would cancel out in the ratios.

		and E866 (left), as well as the Drell-Yan cross section ratio reported
		by SeaQuest\cite{dove2021} (right).}
	\label{fig:csr}
\end{figure}
The preliminary $J/\psi$ $\sigma^{pd}/2\sigma^{pp}$ ratios are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:csr}. The SeaQuest measurement is at a lower energy and higher $x_F$
compared to previous measurements. The preliminary result is consistent with unity
within uncertainty, in qualitative agreement with earlier measurement at \SI{450}{\GeV}
by the NA51 Collaboration \cite{abreu1998} and \SI{800}{\GeV} by the E866 Collaboration
\cite{peng2003}.

While the Drell-Yan process proceeds via electromagnetic interaction sensitive
to the quarks and antiquarks distribution, the charmonium production is a strong
interaction sensitive to the gluon contents of the colliding nucleons. These
different characteristics between the two processes are reflected in the
$\sigma^{pd}/2\sigma^{pp}$ ratios. While Drell-Yan ratios is significantly different
from unity as a result of the $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ flavor asymmetry of the light-quark sea,
the $J/\psi$ production cross section ratio is close to unity.

The CEM and NRQCD calculation are shown as green dotted line and orange solid line
respectively. The difference between the two calculations reflects the greater
importance of the quark-antiquark annihilation in the NRQCD calculation.

\section{Conclusions}
The simultaneous measurement of the charmonium production and the Drell-Yan dimuons
in the SeaQuest experiment allows for a comparison of the two distinct processes. The
extracted $J/\psi$ production cross section is in good agreement with both the CEM
and NRQCD calculation. The $\sigma^{pd}/2\sigma^{pp}$ $J/\psi$ production cross section ratio
is close to unity, and the difference between the $J/\psi$ and Drell-Yan
ratio is reflecting the different mechanism between the two process.

From the E866 measurment of the $\Upsilon$ production \cite{brown2001}, it was observed the
the polarization is different between $\Upsilon(1S)$ and the excited states. It is possible
that the polarization of $J/\psi$ and the excited states would be differet. Furthermore,
predictions from the NRQCD calculation also suggest the quark-antiquark annihilation would
be more important in the $\psi^\prime$ production, and hence one would expect $\psi^\prime$
to have a broader $x_F$ distribution to $J/\psi$. The extraction of the $\psi^\prime$
cross section is currently underway and would be able to provide further input to
the understanding of charmonium production. Moreover, the data from the remaining
data sets would roughly double the statistics for both the charmonium production as well as the Drell-Yan.
The SpinQuest experiment, the follow-up experiment of SeaQuest, will measure the dimuon
production with proton on transversely polarized ammonia target, which can provide information
on the transverse spin asymmetry of charmonium production.
